# Homelab

This repository contains Docker Compose files for various applications I run on my homelab. Currently, I am running these applications on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. 

The purpose of my homelab is to learn valuable skills in containerization, system admistration, and experiment with new technologies.

In my setup, Nginx is the reverse proxy.
